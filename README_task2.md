# Task 2 – Phishing Email Analysis

This repository contains an anonymized analysis of a sample phishing email for Task 2 of the Cybersecurity Internship.

## Objective
Identify phishing indicators in a suspicious email and recommend remediation steps.

## Files
- `phishing_analysis_anonymized.pdf` → Full anonymized analysis report.
- `phishing_evidence_anonymized.txt` → Extracted headers and link evidence (anonymized).
- `README.md` → This file.

## Key Takeaways
- Phishing attacks commonly use display-name spoofing, mismatched URLs, urgent language, and header manipulation.
- Implement email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) and user training to reduce risk.
- Report suspicious emails to the security team and use URL reputation services to block malicious sites.

## Tools Used
- Email client / saved email file for analysis
- Online header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox, Google tools) for header inspection
- Browser to hover links and inspect targets (or use curl to validate)
